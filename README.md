# Discord Music Bot

A discord bot with basic music playing features. Replace the bot token with yours before using. You must have `ffmpeg` installed as well as required libraries:

- youtube_dl
- requests
- PyNaCl

**Missing Features:** There is no queue, trying to play a song while another one is playing just causes an error.
